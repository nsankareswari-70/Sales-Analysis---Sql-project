## roject Overview:
Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

This project helped me to demonstrate my SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.
